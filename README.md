# WHY BUSY?
Over the past years, the Internet has risen to become a dominant force in the world economy, more specifically with social media platforms, e-commerce, and online services. 
The amount of money generated is astonishing. Facebook and Youtube had more than $10 billion in revenue in the 2nd fiscal quarter 2016. Uber and Airbnb, the top unicorns are valued at $20 billion or more. Paypal 2015 revenue is $9.24 billion. They're seemingly everywhere, backed by a bull market and a new generation of so-called disruptive technology. It’s important to remember that the value created on these networks, which allows these platforms to generate huge profits, comes directly from their users. 


As a non-profit organization, BUSY aims to bring value back to the people by replacing these monolithic, centralized, for-profit companies with a Decentralized Open Source Platform, enabled by Blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. We believe that Steem with Graphene can fulfill this mission notably through its high scalability and zero transaction fee model. 



# WHAT IS BUSY?
Using the power of the Steem blockchain, Busy is an **Open-Source** social network and communication platform that extends itself to a variety of rich features and functionality including free digital payments and a marketplace for goods and services. On top of that, Busy is also a Non-profit organization offering open-source projects on Steem, which aims to bridge the gap between the old economy and a new economy giving value back to people. Our goal is to develop the best strategy to bootstrap this thriving eco-system and to enable billions of people to take part in this revolution


## Busy is:
* A non-profit organization: all donations and potential income will be entirely used to pay expenses and develop the project


* An open-source project and vision: we believe in the wisdom of the crowd and in taking a collaborative and transparent approach, that's why all our work will be open source. Everyone is free to contribute, by all appropriate means to accomplish our mission. Not only coders but also designers, writers, speakers, evangelists, marketers, advisors, etc.


* A social media platform on Steem more like Facebook/Twitter/Rocket.Chat than Reddit/Medium like: On Busy we try to build a platform where everyone can participate, not only bloggers/writers. Not only focus on Money/rewards, but you can also come to chat about different topics, use private messaging, enjoy all type of contents, and bookmark it.


* An alternative interface to Steemit: we work on a different approach with a user-friendly interface and specific marketing for mass adoption aiming to remove all the blockchain and cryptocurrency friction, to make it easier to adopt by everyone and every possible niche.


* An open platform for a future marketplace for Good and services: Busy goal is to build on top of the Busy social media platform, several Apps (like Facebook Apps, or WeChat services). We are offering a secure social network layer to bootstrap any Apps, games, community tools, marketplaces for good (like eBay, OpenBazaar), or services (Airbnb, Uber, Fiverr, etc.).All developers can submit their project/concept and can be integrated into the Busy ecosystem very easily. We are building this All-in-one platform, embedding killers App into a social network, empowering people using the power of Steem *zero transaction fee*.




## Busy is Not:
* A Steemit competitor: we are not. We believe that we can be complementary to the existing projects like Steemit on this Blockchain. We are working on another approach, another strategy. Both are mandatory. In fact, Busy can bring value to the Steem ecosystem, by adding even more decentralization, diluting the power and providing more trust on the Steem blockchain. By not being the main/official app on Steem, it gives the Busy project more flexibility. Busy will work in close collaboration with Steemit team and have the support of Steemit inc. to bring more value to the Steem Blockchain making it more reliable,  trustable, decentralized.

# OUR GOAL/ VISION
Our goal is to connect billions of people to the best social network platform that can bring value back to the people in a peer-to-peer and decentralized way using the power of the Steem blockchain and cryptocurrencies. 



### Ensuring compensation for the creators of value
Artists and User-generated content create billions dollars worth of value absorbed by the shareholders of these intermediaries and centralized services. 
As a non-profit and decentralized organization, Busy provides the power of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations within a platform that returns much of its value to the creators ensuring fair compensation.


### Creating a true sharing economy
Uber or Airbnb are often described as the sharing economy, a beautiful notion that peers create and share in value. But these businesses have little to do with sharing, they in fact only aggregate as middlemen through their centralized, proprietary platforms and do resell by taking huge commissions. 
Today's big disrupters are about to get disrupted! Busy aims to create a true peer-to-peer sharing economy without middlemen and zero transaction fees that allows people to transact safely and freely.


### Ending the remittance ripoff
The largest flow of funds into the developing world is not foreign aid but money repatriated to developing countries from their families living abroad. Using Western Union, Moneygram, and other centralized services, the process takes time, patience and costs from 5 to 25% commission. Selling goods or services using eBay, Paypal, makes 1 to 10% commission. The Busy goal is to end the remittance ripoff providing a digital wallet that allows everyone to send/receive digital money with no transaction fees.

_**Our secret : make it easy-to-use and -to-understand for everyone.**_
